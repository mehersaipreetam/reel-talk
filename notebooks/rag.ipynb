Marshall then proceeds to tell Barney (who keeps interrupting to point out the obvious inconsistencies in the story) that he went to seek \"special training\" for the next slap. First, he went to a martial arts learning center to ask the teacher for a class that only teaches slapping.

They make fun of what could have happened and ended up kissing. Continuity [ ] This episode references two bets which Barney had lost, the Slap Bet and the Ducky Tie . Marshall receives three slaps (four in total) in exchange for Barney removing the Ducky Tie, and uses two. Ted uses the phrases \"therapisted\" and \"boy scouted\"; Marshall often uses the phrase \" lawyered .\" In the beginning of the episode, it is said that \"you haven\\'t truly lived until somewhere, somebody puts a sign out because of something you did\", while showing some examples. One of those examples is a sign saying \"No motorcycles on the casino floor.\" This is a future reference to The Magician\\'s Code - Part One , where Barney rides a motorcycle inside the casino in Atlantic City where he and Marshall are stranded. He is arrested by security, but is subsequently released because there\\'s no written rule about motorcycles being forbidden - until the sign, which according to Future Ted , is still there to this day.

Marshall wonders how they are supposed to make something memorable for Barney, who makes every night the best night of his life. At the point, Robin suggests that they give him the worst night of his life. They arranged everything with Quinn, Ralph Macchio, Loretta and the casino owner to make Barney think that his life is ruined. For the finale, they pretend that the mobsters chopped Marshall\\'s hand off in front of Barney and the mobsters then drag Barney upstairs to his apartment. As he enters the apartment, everyone yells out \"Surprise!\" Barney is confused, but they come clean and Robin tells him that they decided to give him everything on his list without him even realizing.

The gang is shocked by the syrupy sweet family. Once his mother is out of earshot, Barney explains that Betty and Tyler are actually actors he hired to play his family.
