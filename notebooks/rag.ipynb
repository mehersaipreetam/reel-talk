Ted uses the phrases \"therapisted\" and \"boy scouted\"; Marshall often uses the phrase \" lawyered .\" In the beginning of the episode, it is said that \"you haven\\'t truly lived until somewhere, somebody puts a sign out because of something you did\", while showing some examples. One of those examples is a sign saying \"No motorcycles on the casino floor.\" This is a future reference to The Magician\\'s Code - Part One , where Barney rides a motorcycle inside the casino in Atlantic City where he and Marshall are stranded.
