       "'Images (13) Future Ted begins telling his two kids the story of how he met their mother. He introduces Barney, Lily, Marshall and Robin, telling his kids how Lily and Marshall got engaged and how he met Robin.  Contents 1 Recap 2 Continuity 3 Future References (Contains Spoilers) 4 Gallery 5 Memorable Quotes 6 Notes and Trivia 6.1 Goofs and Errors 6.2 Allusions and Outside References 6.3 Music 6.4 Other Notes 6.1 Goofs and Errors 6.2 Allusions and Outside References 6.3 Music 6.4 Other Notes 7 Awards 8 Guests 9 Reception 10 References 11 External links Recap [ ] The episode (and series) begins with future Ted announcing to his two teenaged children that he will be telling them the story of how he met their mother . They are unamused. In 2005, law student Marshall decides to propose to kindergarten teacher Lily , his longtime girlfriend. As he rehearses the proposal to their college friend/roommate Ted at the Apartment , Marshall asks Ted what he\\'ll be doing that night while they get engaged. This causes Ted to reflect on his life; believing that at age 27 he feels ready to start searching for his soulmate, \"the one\". At MacLaren\\'s , the local bar situated underneath their apartment block, along with close friend and smooth-talking womanizer Barney , Ted meets Robin , a journalist at Metro News 1 , who is new in town. Their eyes meet across the room and Ted points her out to Barney, who makes a crude remark. Ted begins obsessing about the perfect way to approach Robin but Barney simply asks her \" Have you met Ted? \" and the two strike up a conversation. They go on to have a successful date, which ends early with Robin being called away to report a news story. Ted realizes he may have missed \"the signal\" to kiss Robin, and tries to arrange another time to meet her. He symbolically steals an ornamental Blue French Horn from the restaurant where he and Robin had their first date, then heads to her apartment . After Robin invites him inside, they begin to slow dance. They take turns listing things they like about one another until Ted spontaneously announces \"I think I\\'m in love with you\". Robin is stunned and confused, so Ted goes to leave. After a lingering goodbye, in which Ted explains he\\'s \"not good at being single\", he once again misses \"the signal\" to kiss her, disappointing his friends back at the bar as he later recounts shaking her hand. The episode ends in 2030, with Ted telling his children this is how he met their Aunt Robin, not their mother. Continuity [ ] Barney begins insisting that he is Ted\\'s best friend in this episode. Barney breaks up words by saying \" wait for it \" in between syllables for the first time. Barney first mentions his blog . Barney\\'s love of Laser tag is introduced. Barney\\'s dislike of the concept of marriage (\"[death is] a perfect metaphor\"), and related mocking of Marshall and Lily \\'s plans to marry, is introduced. Marshall is the first character in the show referred to as \"Uncle\". Barney plays his \" Have you met Ted? \" game for the first time. Ted\\'s architecture career, Lily\\'s job as a kindergarten teacher, Marshall studying law, and Robin\\'s journalism career at Metro News 1 are all introduced. Marshall and Lily getting together in the first week of their freshman year of college is first mentioned. Game Night depicts an event immediately after the end of the episode. Ted saying \"I love you\" to Robin on the first date is referenced repeatedly in future episodes, including Purple Giraffe    , Game Night , First Time In New York , The Leap ,    and Mystery vs. History    . Marshall does the robot, a dance move that he uses on several other occasions, including in Okay Awesome , The Limo    , and Life Among the Gorillas (where Marshall refers to the robot dance as \"old reliable\"). Barney\\'s \"Have you met Ted?\" game is adapted for other people in future episodes, including Robin in The Duel and Marshall in The Scorpion and the Toad    ; Barney is also seen using it on himself (\"Have you met me?\") and simultaneously with his brother James (\"Have you met my brother?\") in Single Stamina    , and he teaches it to Justin and Kyle in Sunrise . Robin\\'s recently dumped friend reappears in Zip, Zip, Zip    , where her only line (\"What\\'s taking so long?\") is the same as it is here. Barney\\'s catchphrase Suit Up ! is introduced. The origin of the phrase is explained in Game Night . Marshall says that Ted has always described his perfect woman as liking dogs, and in Cupcake , Ted claims that he\\'s only attracted to \"dog people\". Ted stealing the Blue French Horn is referred to throughout the series, as seen in Come On    , Something Blue    , Shelter Island    , Twin Beds , Platonish , and Last Forever - Part Two . Lily and Marshall have sex on the kitchen floor again after the second time they get engaged in Atlantic City    , and while testing their new carpet samples in The Chain of Screaming    . Marshall popping the champagne cork into Lily\\'s eye is referenced again in Atlantic City and Zoo or False . Also, in The Limo, Lily is seen to flinch much more than the rest of the gang when Ted uncorks the champagne bottle. Ted states that he was in the top bunk when Lily and Marshall had sex for the first time, as depicted in First Time In New York . In Monday Night Football , Robin is only seen joining in on the gang\\'s annual tradition of watching the Super Bowl together in 2006, as they only met her here, in the fall of 2005, after the Super Bowl. Ted\\'s first meeting with Barney is expanded upon in How I Met Everyone Else    , where they do indeed meet at the urinal. The story of how Robin met Barney and Ted, particularly Barney saying \"Oh yeah, you just know she likes it dirty\", is referenced again in How I Met Everyone Else , Farhampton , and Knight Vision . When Ted and Barney first met, Barney says \"Ted, I\\'m going to teach you how to live.\" He told Marshall the same thing when they first met, as revealed in How I Met Everyone Else . Barney also tells Ted that he is going to \"re-teach\" him how to live in Wait For It , and says it to Justin and Kyle in Sunrise . Marshall injures someone by popping a champagne cork in their eye again in Dowisetrepla    , where he does so to Wendy the Waitress with the \"comically-large champagne bottle\". Ted has a beard and mustache in the flashback to him meeting Barney for the first time. He is shown with a goatee in the flashback to 2002 in Double Date , and with similar facial hair in the flashback to Barney\\'s days as Insane Duane \\'s best friend in Symphony of Illumination . Barney says \"This just in...\" as a double entendre for sex. Lily imagines Robin doing the same thing when convincing Marshall not to tell the gang about their decision to start a family in Doppelgangers    . Marshall assures Lily that he did not want to be kissed by another person (Barney), and later does the same in Jenkins    , after Jenkins kisses him. In Baby Talk    , Lily shoots down Marshall\\'s suggestion to name their child \"Rob\", revealing that the kid who \"got to second base\" with her and left a purple hand print on her breast is named Rob. A similar opening sequence appears in Symphony of Illumination , when Robin is talking to her imaginary children. Robin complains about doing fluff pieces at her news station, and her frustration with doing such pieces is referenced again in several episodes, including Purple Giraffe and Do I Know You?    . She eventually quits her job at Metro News 1 in I Heart NJ     and ultimately becomes a famous journalist by Last Forever - Part Two , 25 years later. Ted tells Yasmin he wants a band and not a DJ for his future wedding. In Band or DJ? , however, he attempts to convince Robin to get a DJ instead of a band for her wedding, apparently because he is having trouble with the idea of Robin marrying Barney, and is equating the two decisions. Robin says she hates olives here, but changes her mind about them by Platonish , as seen there in a flashback, making Ted hopeful that she might also change her mind about being with him. This implies Ted no longer believes in the \" Olive Theory \" he explains to Robin here; indeed, it is proven false here itself when it is revealed that Marshall and Lily both like olives. Marshall kisses a man again in The Broath , when he and Ted kiss as part of the gang\\'s apology to Barney. Barney says that he\\'s going to give Marshall a wedding present, which is \"Don\\'t get married\". This is the same line Barney\\'s brother James will say to Barney in The Poker Game . As seen in How Your Mother Met Me , the events in this episode happen on the same night as The Mother \\'s 21st birthday party, which she celebrates at another bar called MacLaren\\'s. Her friend Kelly gets the two confused, and runs out of the gang\\'s pub just as Barney gets ready to play \"Have you met Ted?\" Future Ted mentions that he found out years later that his friends were right and Robin was indeed giving him \"the signal\" to kiss after their first date, as seen in Sunrise . Robin living alone in a large Brooklyn apartment , despite having recently arrived in New York as a junior TV news reporter with a small salary ( Return of the Shirt ), foreshadows what the others learn about her family in Unpause . Robin is again living there in 2030 in Last Forever - Part Two . Ted\\'s kids in the future. Ted explains \"The Olive Theory\" to Robin Ted and Robin on their first date, seeing the Blue French Horn. Lily after finger painting day at school Marshall and Lily celebrate their engagement The result of an accident with the champagne Ted sees Robin for the first time Ted and Robin after their first date Robin gives Ted the \\'signal\\' when they shake hands Memorable Quotes [ ] (Barney spontaneously kisses Marshall) Notes and Trivia [ ] Goofs and Errors [ ] In the scene with Marshall and Lily with the champagne bottle, the first scene shows the bottle covered in foil, but in the last where Marshall uncorks it, there is no foil. Ted tells his children that back in 2005 he had a full head of hair. However, he still has a full head of hair when the 2030 Ted is shown in \"Last Forever (Part 2)\", meaning that the use of the word \"had\" is arbitrary. He could have meant it metaphorically, as in full of hope for his future. He could have meant it metaphorically, as in full of hope for his future. In the scene where Ted meets Robin, Robin first has her hair covering her ears, but in the next shot, she has her hair behind her ears. In the scene where Robin was covering the \"jumper story\", instead of saying Metro News 1 she says Metro 1 News. As in other early episodes from the first season, Robin\\'s surname is pronounced Sher-BAT-sky instead of Sher-BAH-tsky. In Barney\\'s first scene, when he\\'s getting a shave, the barber was holding and using the straight razor incorrectly. It\\'s fairly useless to move the razor in the opposite direction of the blade edge but may have been done for safety reasons. Ranjit\\'s cab clearly pulls up to a space on the side of the road outside Robin\\'s apartment, but in all the scenes in Ranjit\\'s cab, the backdrop in the rear window shows his cab in the middle of the road. In the scene where Ted goes to Robin\\'s apartment to give her the blue French horn, Robin\\'s kitchen appears to be on the right side of her hearth. However, in later seasons her kitchen is on the left side. The couch that the Ted\\'s kids are sitting on changes from Purple Giraffe onwards. Their clothes as well as the decoration of the room they\\'re sitting in also changes. The blue French Horn is actually a concert mellophone, the much rarer sister of the mellophone, which is an instrument used predominantly in modern Drum and Bugle Corps. Allusions and Outside References [ ] When Ted sees the blue French horn, he calls it a \"Smurf Penis,\" which he tells his son is typically a bad idea on a first date. The Smurfs were a fictional group of small sky blue creatures who live somewhere in the forests of medieval Europe. They began in a Belgian comic strip in 1958, but gained the most popularity from the Hanna-Barbera television series, which ran from 1981 to 1989. Interestingly, Neil Patrick Harris (Barney) starred in The Smurfs movie, only 6 years later. Interestingly, Neil Patrick Harris (Barney) starred in The Smurfs movie, only 6 years later. When Ted is telling Marshall and Lily the story of his first date with Robin, Marshall mentions that Ted\\'s perfect woman \"can quote obscure lines from Ghostbusters\". Robin is then shown to quote \"Ray! When someone asks you if you\\'re a god, you say \"Yes!\" Robin is then shown to quote \"Ray! When someone asks you if you\\'re a god, you say \"Yes!\" Music [ ] Otis Redding - Cigarettes and Coffee The Pretenders - Back on the Chain Gang The theme song for the show is \\'Hey Beautiful\\' by The Solids , which includes writers/producers/co-creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas . Other Notes [ ] In his audition, which included the laser tag scene, Neil Patrick Harris did the dive roll that he does in this episode. Alyson Hannigan , who was in the next room during Harris\\'s audition, asked Harris to bump the wall when he did the dive so that she knew that he had done it. Harris misjudged the space and he hit the wall harder than he intended knocking himself out. The champagne that the group drinks at the end of the episode was real champagne, but the actors (including Marshall Manesh, who plays Ranjit, who doesn\\'t drink alcohol because of religious reasons) didn\\'t know that fact until they drank it. This is one of the few episodes along with Game Night , Hopeless , 46 Minutes      and How Your Mother Met Me to forgo the traditional opening Theme Song (the yellow-tinted montage of the photographs containing all five main characters). Instead, you see a series of non-tinted photographs of Ted, Marshall, and some unnamed female friends. This is the only episode in Season 1 to feature a cold open with fresh footage and not cut directly into the opening titles. Such a feature will only become regular in Season 2 onward. This episode features an audio commentary by show creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas , Director Pamela Fryman and cast members Josh Radnor , Jason Segel , Cobie Smulders , Alyson Hannigan and Neil Patrick Harris . It is revealed that in college, the bottom bunk was Marshall\\'s and the top was Ted\\'s.
